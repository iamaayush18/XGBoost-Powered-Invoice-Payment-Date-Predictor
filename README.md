ML-Based Payment Date Prediction Model
Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the due payment dates of pending invoices for various companies. The goal is to leverage historical data and machine learning techniques to improve the prediction of when invoices will be paid. This can be crucial for managing cash flow, financial planning, and improving business operations.

Problem Statement
Businesses often face challenges in predicting when invoices will be paid. Late payments can disrupt cash flow and business operations. By creating a regressor-based model, this project aims to provide accurate predictions for when outstanding payments will be received, based on past invoice data.

Project Structure
H2HBABBA1250.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
ML-BASED-PAYMENT-DATE-PREDICTION-MODEL.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Project overview and documentation (this file).
Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the invoice data for analysis.
Model Selection: Uses regression models to predict payment dates based on historical patterns.
Evaluation: Provides metrics to assess model performance.
Dataset
The dataset (H2HBABBA1250.csv) contains historical data on invoice payments. It includes features such as:

Invoice ID: Unique identifier for each invoice.
Company Name: Name of the company issuing the invoice.
Invoice Amount: Amount due for each invoice.
Payment Date: Actual payment date.
Due Date: Due date for the payment.

Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2.Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip.
3.Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the .ipynb file to run the model.
4.Train and Test the Model: Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and test its performance.

Models Used
The project uses various regression models, including:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
These models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting payment dates.

Results
The model performance is measured using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Future Work
Experiment with more advanced models such as neural networks.
Integrate additional features like payment terms, company size, and industry type.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
